\title{Local Efficiency}
\usage{
network_local_efficiency(x, weights = NULL, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Network input: matrix, igraph, network, cograph_network, or tna object}

\item{weights}{Edge weights (NULL for unweighted). Set to NA to ignore existing weights.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to \code{\link{to_igraph}}}
}
\value{
Numeric in [0, 1]: average local efficiency
}
\description{
Computes the average local efficiency across all nodes. Local efficiency
of a node is the global efficiency of its neighborhood subgraph
(excluding the node itself). Measures fault tolerance and local integration.
}
\examples{
# Complete graph: removing any node leaves complete subgraph, so local efficiency = 1
k5 <- matrix(1, 5, 5); diag(k5) <- 0
network_local_efficiency(k5)  # 1

# Star: neighbors not connected to each other
star <- matrix(c(0,1,1,1,1, 1,0,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0,0, 1,0,0,0,0), 5, 5)
network_local_efficiency(star)  # 0
}
