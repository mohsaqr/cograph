\arguments{
\item{sym_matrix}{A symmetric matrix representing undirected relationships.
These edges will be drawn straight without arrows.}

\item{asym_matrix}{An asymmetric matrix representing directed relationships.
These edges will be drawn curved with arrows. Reciprocal edges curve in
opposite directions.}

\item{layout}{Layout algorithm or coordinate matrix. Default "circle".}

\item{sym_color}{Color for symmetric/undirected edges. Default "gray40".}

\item{asym_color}{Color for asymmetric/directed edges. Can be a single color
or a vector of two colors for positive/negative directions. Default
c("steelblue", "coral").}

\item{curvature}{Curvature magnitude for directed edges. Default 0.3.}

\item{edge_width}{Edge width. Default 2.5.}

\item{node_size}{Node size. Default 8.}

\item{title}{Plot title. Default NULL.}

\item{edge_labels}{Show edge weight labels. Default TRUE.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to splot().}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the combined cograph_network object.

\description{
Plot a network combining symmetric (undirected) and asymmetric
(directed) matrices with appropriate edge styling.

Creates a network visualization combining edges from a symmetric matrix
(rendered as straight undirected edges) and an asymmetric matrix
(rendered as curved directed edges).
}
\examples{
# Create symmetric matrix (undirected)
sym <- matrix(0, 4, 4, dimnames = list(LETTERS[1:4], LETTERS[1:4]))
sym[1,2] <- sym[2,1] <- 0.5
sym[3,4] <- sym[4,3] <- 0.6

# Create asymmetric matrix (directed)
asym <- matrix(0, 4, 4, dimnames = list(LETTERS[1:4], LETTERS[1:4]))
asym[1,3] <- 0.7
asym[3,1] <- 0.3
asym[2,4] <- 0.8
asym[4,2] <- 0.4

# Plot combined network
plot_mixed_network(sym, asym, title = "Mixed Network")
