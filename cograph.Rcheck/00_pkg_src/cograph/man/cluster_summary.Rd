\usage{
cluster_summary(
  x,
  clusters,
  method = c("sum", "mean", "median", "max", "min", "density", "geomean"),
  directed = TRUE
)

csum(
  x,
  clusters,
  method = c("sum", "mean", "median", "max", "min", "density", "geomean"),
  directed = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Adjacency matrix (numeric matrix with node names as row/colnames)}

\item{clusters}{Either a named list of node vectors, or a membership vector
(integer vector where clusters[i] is the cluster of node i)}

\item{method}{Aggregation method: "sum", "mean", "median", "max", "min",
"density", "geomean"}

\item{directed}{Logical; if TRUE, treat network as directed}
}
\value{
A \code{cluster_summary} object with:
\item{between}{Matrix of between-cluster aggregated weights}
\item{within}{Vector of within-cluster aggregated weights}
\item{cluster_sizes}{Number of nodes per cluster}
\item{cluster_names}{Names of clusters}
}
\description{
Computes aggregated edge weights between and within clusters.
Results are numerically identical to igraph's contract_vertices + simplify.
}
\examples{
# Create adjacency matrix
mat <- matrix(runif(100), 10, 10)
diag(mat) <- 0
rownames(mat) <- colnames(mat) <- LETTERS[1:10]

# Define clusters
clusters <- list(
  G1 = c("A", "B", "C"),
  G2 = c("D", "E", "F"),
  G3 = c("G", "H", "I", "J")
)

# Compute summary
result <- cluster_summary(mat, clusters)
result$between  # Between-cluster matrix
result$within   # Within-cluster values
}
